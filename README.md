# Pattern Design Problems
### Patterns are a handy application of loops and will provide better clarity and understanding of the implementation of loops.
Before printing any pattern, we must consider the following three things:

●  The first step in printing any pattern is to figure out the number of rows that the pattern requires.

●  Next, we should know how many columns are there in the ith row.

●  Once, we have figured out the number of rows and columns, then focus on the pattern to print.
